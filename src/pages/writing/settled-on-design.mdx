A personal website is meant to be your home on the internet. An expression of your interests, your passions, and your personality. It is supposed to represent _you_. Over the past year, I've redesigned this website 6 times, and I've deployed it 5 times.
Each time, I was happy with it for a few weeks. I was proud of what I'd accomplished. Unfortunately, as time passed, the design didn't quite spark that same joy. At some point, it had become a running joke...the website would never quite be done.

Until I started this iteration, I didn't quite realise exactly why I never felt content with a design for longer than a few months at most. However, at some point, working on the design I've come to understand the reason.

Each day, I have new experiences. I learn new things and talk to different people, and every day my perspective on the world shifts ever so slightly. Well, if my site is meant to be a reflection of who I am, and who I am changes every day, then does it not stand to reason that my site should change to reflect that?
I won't go as far as to say that no part of the constant redesigns wasn't a result of perfectionism or even laziness, but I think it is important to recognize that the primary reason I never felt content with the design because I was growing, as a designer, as a developer, and most importantly as a person.

So, with that said, the title of this post is a bit misleading. As of now, I am quite fond of this design, and I don't see myself attempting another redesign in the near future, but I am sure that someday, another redesign will certainly come about. I look forward to that day because it means that I am continuing to grow and that my skills are continuing to improve.

##### Past Designs

Here is a log of some of my past designs. Hopefully, they reflect the growth I've spoken about throughout this post.
