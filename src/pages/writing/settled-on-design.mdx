# Why did I start?

It's been less than a year since I created this site. I recall vividly that at the time I was super proud and happy with it. It felt like me. As much as pixels on a screen can truly represent me.

However, coming back to it with a fresh set of eyes, I realized that I no longer appreciate a lot of the choices that I made.

The logo, colors, spacing, tone of voice — it all felt somewhat foreign. How could something so recent and intimate feel unfamiliar?

Paco gave me an interesting insight into this phenomenon: it shows how much I've changed and learned in the past year.

I pondered over throwing away the whole thing and starting from scratch. It felt easier and cleaner. Eventually, sober thoughts prevailed and I managed to shape an existing piece of dough into something new, while keeping the parts that I still found interesting.

To be honest, the changes weren't that substantial. Adjusting typography and colors already goes a long way. Building a operating system-esque dock bar was also amusing.

Does personal, timeless design even exist? Or is it inevitable for our creations to continuously go through the motions and re-designs with each iteration reflecting our given state of mind?

I might be writing a similar entry less than a year from now. Only time can tell...

```ts
export const name = () => {
  return "Nirjhor Nath";
};
